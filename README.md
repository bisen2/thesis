# Ben's Honors Thesis

This repo contains three folders:
1. paper: This is a directory that holds the actual thesis document. It includes tex files and the compiled pdf
2. src_poster: This contains all of the files related to the poster presented at the UVM Student Research Conference 4/17/2019
3. src_poster_lots_of_text: This is a copy of the original poster I made for the SRC. It was later changed to have less text and be more reader friendly, but I figured the information on this would still be useful to have

This repo also contains a pdf of the original project proposal from Spring 2018
